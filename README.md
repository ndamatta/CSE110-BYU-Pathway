[CSE 110] üñ•Ô∏è Programming Building Blocks: Assignments

<h3>Hi! This is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanael-damatta/">Natanael</a></h3>

In this repository you will find <b>almost</b> all the assignments of <strong>CSE101.</strong> I hope it helps future students at BYU-Pathway Connect<br>
Each folder contains the Checkpoint, Team and Prove assignments of every week. 
<br>
‚Ä¢ I finished this course with an A+ grade.<br>
‚Ä¢ All assignments are done by <b>me</b> during the course, these are not the only way to accomplish it.<br> 
‚Ä¢ All assignments passed the score and were checked<br>
‚Ä¢ Some assignments don't have the stretch challange done since I was lazy hahah, but most do.<br>

Please feel free to make a pull request (changes) if you consider that there is something to update or improve. I tried to do my best and be as tidy as possible.<br>

<b>DISCLAIMER::</b><br>
‚Ä¢ Follow your instructor's advices in EVERY assignment. Before checking for something here, go and ask help to your classmates. They're really cool and are always willing to help<br> 
‚Ä¢ I <strong>DON'T</strong> encourage cheating on assignments, if you are really doing the course it is to learn, and these assignments help you a lot with that.<br>
‚Ä¢ I <strong>REJECT</strong> any charge of encouraging students to cheat, knowing that it is against <a href="https://dfkpq46c1l9o7.cloudfront.net/pdfs/148e250c14f5be811f0c42353b9d46dc.pdf">BYU's Honor Code.</a><br>
‚Ä¢ This repository has the purpose that, if any student feels stuck in a task, he can have an idea of what steps to take and how the operation is carried out.<br>

This course helped me to realize how much I like programming, and I hope it does the same for you. Try your best to learn, understand, and complete the assignments. It will be a solid foundation for the following courses.
This is an inspired course from the Church. All the instructors try their best to help us to learn and achieve our goals.

Thanks for reading!<br>
