<ul>
  <li>Always follow your instructor's advice for EACH assignment. If you're facing difficulties, seek help from your classmates firstâ€”they're usually very supportive.</li>
  <li>I <strong>DO NOT</strong> endorse cheating on assignments. The purpose of these assignments is to facilitate learning.</li>
  <li>I <strong>STRONGLY OPPOSE</strong> any accusation of promoting cheating, as I am aware that it goes against <a href="https://dfkpq46c1l9o7.cloudfront.net/pdfs/148e250c14f5be811f0c42353b9d46dc.pdf">BYU's Honor Code</a>.</li>
  <li>This repository aims to provide guidance to students who may feel stuck on a task. It offers insights into the steps and processes involved.</li>
</ul>

Taking this course allowed me to discover my passion for programming, and I hope it has a similar impact on you. Put in your best effort to learn, comprehend, and complete the assignments; they will establish a strong foundation for your future courses.
The course draws inspiration from the Church, and the instructors are dedicated to helping us learn and achieve our goals.

Thank you for taking the time to read through this! If you're interested, you can also connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanael-damatta/">LinkedIn</a>. :)
