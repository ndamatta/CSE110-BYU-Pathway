This program is a shape calculator that computes the area of different shapes based on user input.<br>
It defines three functions to calculate the area of a square, rectangle, and circle. The program prompts users to input a shape choice and, depending on the chosen shape, asks for relevant measurements. It then calculates and displays the area of the selected shape.<br>
The program features a user-friendly interface, conditional statements, and modular functions for area calculation. This demonstrates abilities in user interaction, function definition, conditional branching, and modular code design for solving mathematical problems.
